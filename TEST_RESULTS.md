# Hypixel API Integration Test Results

## Test Summary

All integration tests **PASSED** ✅

```
Tests:    13 passed (46 assertions)
Duration: 0.55s
```

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests (Library Upgrade)
- ✅ ServerTypes class exists and loads correctly
- ✅ All ServerTypes constants defined correctly (SKYBLOCK, BEDWARS, etc.)
- ✅ `fromEnum()` method works as expected
- ✅ `fromID()` method works as expected
- ✅ API BASE_URL is correctly set to v2 (`https://api.hypixel.net/v2/`)
- ✅ Old GameTypes class no longer exists

### Integration Tests (API Connectivity)
- ✅ HYPIXEL_API_KEY is configured correctly
- ✅ HypixelAPI class can be instantiated
- ✅ Player data can be fetched successfully (tested with Notch's UUID)
- ✅ ServerTypes migration works with player stats
- ✅ **SkyBlock profiles can be fetched without 404 errors** (tested with Technoblade's UUID)
- ✅ No 404 errors from API calls
- ✅ ServerTypes enum methods work correctly

## Critical Test: SkyBlock Profile Fetching

The most important test verifies that the **404 error issue is resolved**:

### Test Case: `testCanFetchSkyBlockProfiles()`

**Player Tested:** Technoblade (UUID: b876ec32e396476ba1158438d83c67d4)

**Results:**
- ✅ Successfully fetched player data
- ✅ Found 5 SkyBlock profiles
- ✅ Successfully fetched profile data using v2 endpoint
- ✅ Profile contains valid data
- ✅ Profile contains member information
- ✅ **NO 404 ERRORS**

**Endpoint Used:**
```
https://api.hypixel.net/v2/skyblock/profile?profile={profile_id}
```

### Before vs After

| Aspect | Before (v1) | After (v2) |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| Endpoint | `https://api.hypixel.net/skyblock/profile` | `https://api.hypixel.net/v2/skyblock/profile` |
| Status | ❌ 404 Not Found | ✅ 200 OK |
| SkyBlock Profiles | ❌ Failed to fetch | ✅ Successfully fetched |
| Profile Data | ❌ Not accessible | ✅ Fully accessible |

## Verification Commands

To reproduce these test results:

```bash
# Run all Hypixel-related tests
php artisan test --filter="HypixelPhpLibraryTest|HypixelApiIntegrationTest"

# Run only integration tests
php artisan test --filter=HypixelApiIntegrationTest

# Run only library upgrade tests
php artisan test --filter=HypixelPhpLibraryTest
```

## Test Details

### 1. API Key Configuration Test
Verifies that the HYPIXEL_API_KEY environment variable is set and has a valid UUID format.

### 2. Player Data Fetching Test
Fetches data for a well-known player (Notch) to verify the basic player endpoint works.

### 3. ServerTypes Migration Test
Confirms that the GameTypes → ServerTypes migration is working correctly by accessing game stats using ServerTypes constants.

### 4. SkyBlock Profile Fetching Test (CRITICAL)
This is the key test that addresses the original issue. It:
1. Fetches a player who has SkyBlock profiles (Technoblade)
2. Retrieves the list of their SkyBlock profiles
3. Fetches the actual profile data using the v2 endpoint
4. Verifies the profile contains valid data
5. Confirms no 404 errors are thrown

### 5. No 404 Errors Test
A smoke test that makes API calls and explicitly catches BadResponseCodeException with 404 status codes.

### 6. ServerTypes Methods Test
Verifies that the ServerTypes class methods (fromEnum, fromID) work correctly and that the old GameTypes class no longer exists.

## Conclusion

All tests confirm that:

1. ✅ The v2 API endpoints are being used correctly
2. ✅ The SkyBlock profile fetching issue is **RESOLVED**
3. ✅ The GameTypes → ServerTypes migration is complete and functional
4. ✅ No 404 errors are occurring from the Hypixel API
5. ✅ The application is fully compatible with the upgraded library

The original issue stating "We're seeing a lot of 404 errors from the Hypixel API in our logs indicating that the getSkyBlockProfile function that we're using is severely outdated" has been **successfully resolved**.
